## Overview

**MCP Foxxy Bridge** is a one-to-many proxy for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It lets you aggregate and route requests to multiple MCP servers through a single endpoint, so you can:

- Centralize configuration for all your MCP servers
- Expose all tools, resources, and prompts from connected servers
- Route requests transparently to the right backend
- Use a single MCP endpoint in your AI tools (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.)
